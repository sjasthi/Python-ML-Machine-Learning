## 🤖 How to Use Claude.ai

You are **encouraged** to use Claude.ai, but you must use it **effectively**:

### **✅ GOOD Uses of Claude:**
- "Can you explain feature selection in simple terms for middle school students?"
- "Help me create an analogy for understanding wrapper methods"
- "Generate a code example showing RFE with sklearn"
- "Review my explanation and suggest improvements"
- "Help me create a comparison table for the three methods"
- "Suggest interactive quiz questions about feature selection"

### **❌ BAD Uses of Claude:**
- "Write the entire assignment for me" (You won't learn!)
- Copying and pasting without understanding
- Not reviewing or customizing the output
- Not adding your own examples or voice

### **📝 Required Claude Documentation:**

You MUST submit a separate document called `claude_usage_log.md` that includes:

1. **All prompts you gave to Claude** (copy-paste your questions)
2. **How you used the responses** (what did you keep, change, or reject?)
3. **What you learned from the process**

**Example Entry:**
```markdown
## Prompt 1
**What I asked:** "Explain filter methods for feature selection in simple terms"

**What Claude said:** [paste response]

**How I used it:** I used the analogy Claude suggested about filtering coffee, 
but I changed it to filtering water through a strainer because that's more 
relatable to middle schoolers. I also added my own example about spam filters.

**What I learned:** Filter methods are fast but don't consider feature 
interactions. They're like a first-pass screening.
```

## 📊 Example Claude Usage Log Entry

Here's what a GOOD usage log entry looks like:

```markdown
# Claude Usage Log

## Prompt 1: Understanding Filter Methods
**Date/Time:** 2024-01-15, 3:30 PM

**What I asked Claude:**
"Explain filter methods for feature selection. What makes them 'filter' methods? 
Give me an analogy that middle school students would understand."

**Claude's Response:** [paste full response here]

**How I used it:**
- Kept the main explanation about statistical tests
- CHANGED the analogy: Claude suggested coffee filter, I changed it to 
  "screening basketball players by height" because it's more relatable
- ADDED my own example about spam email filters
- Used the list of scoring functions but added simpler descriptions

**What I learned:**
Filter methods are called "filters" because they filter features before 
training, using statistical tests. They're fast but don't consider how 
features work together. The chi-squared test is for categorical features, 
ANOVA F-test is for continuous features with categorical targets.

**Reflection:**
I needed to ask a follow-up question about when to use chi2 vs f_classif 
because Claude's first explanation was too technical.

---

## Prompt 2: Code Example for SelectKBest
**Date/Time:** 2024-01-15, 4:00 PM

**What I asked Claude:**
"Create Python code showing SelectKBest on the iris dataset. Make it complete 
with comments for beginners. Show before and after feature counts."

**Claude's Response:** [paste code here]

**How I used it:**
- Used the code structure but changed some variable names to be clearer 
  (changed X to features, y to target)
- ADDED print statements to show which features were selected
- ADDED a visualization comparing feature importances
- Rewrote comments in my own words to make them clearer

**What I learned:**
SelectKBest needs a scoring function (I used f_classif). The fit() method 
calculates scores, transform() actually selects features. You can see which 
features were selected using get_support().

**Problems encountered:**
First version didn't show WHICH features were selected, just how many. 
Had to ask Claude for follow-up on accessing feature names.
