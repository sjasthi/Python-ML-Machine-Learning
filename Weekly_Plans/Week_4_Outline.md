## üìù Quiz

### Machine Learning Detective Quiz
- **File:** `ML_Detective_Three_Types_Quiz.html`
- **Instructions:** 
  1. Complete the interactive quiz
  2. Take a screenshot of your final results page showing your score
  3. Submit the screenshot to the designated dropbox
- **Purpose:** Test your ability to classify real-world problems into the correct ML category (Regression, Classification, or Clustering)

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you should be able to:

1. **Identify** the four main types of machine learning approaches
2. **Distinguish** between the three primary algorithm categories  
3. **Classify** real-world problems as regression, classification, or clustering challenges
4. **Apply** decision-making criteria to determine the appropriate ML approach for given scenarios
5. **Demonstrate** understanding through practical problem identification

## üìã Preparation for Next Week

- Review any concepts where you scored low on the quiz
- Think of 2-3 real-world problems you encounter and try to classify them using this week's framework
- Come prepared to discuss practical applications in class

## üí° Study Tips

- **For Presentations:** Take notes on key characteristics of each ML type
- **For Videos:** Pause and try to predict the answer before it's revealed
- **For Quiz:** Read each scenario carefully and think about what the end goal is (predicting numbers, sorting into categories, or finding hidden groups)
