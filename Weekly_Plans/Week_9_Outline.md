# Python for Machine Learning - Week 9 Outline

## Overview

**Course:** Python for Machine Learning  
**Week:** 9  
**Topics:** Multiple Linear Regression & ML Performance Measures

---

## Previous Learning (Week 8 Review)

In Week 8, we explored:
- Simple Linear Regression - our first Machine Learning model
- Understanding the relationship between one independent variable and a dependent variable
- Building and evaluating basic predictive models

## This Week's Focus (Week 9)

### Topic 1: Multiple Linear Regression

Moving from simple to multiple linear regression, we will learn how to:
- Work with multiple independent variables (features)
- Build more complex predictive models
- Understand the relationship between multiple features and the target variable
- Interpret coefficients for multiple predictors

**Reference Material:**

### Topic 2: ML Performance Measures

Understanding how to evaluate machine learning models:
- Different performance measures and their purpose
- When to apply specific measures to ML models
- Comparing model performance using appropriate metrics
- Selecting the right evaluation metric for your problem

**Reference Material:**

## Interactive Learning Activity

### Play: Multiple Regression Interactive Visualization

**Activity:** Download and explore the interactive web page to understand Multiple Regression concepts visually

**Download Link:**  
https://github.com/sjasthi/Python-ML-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Play/ML_Interactive_multiple_regression.html

**What you'll explore:**
- How multiple features interact to predict outcomes
- Visual representation of regression with multiple variables
- Interactive manipulation of parameters
- Real-time model behavior

## Questions to Ponder

Reflect on these questions as you learn about Multiple Linear Regression:

1. **What are the differences between Simple Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression?**

2. **When would you choose Multiple Linear Regression over Simple Linear Regression, and why?**

3. **How do we interpret coefficients in Multiple Linear Regression when we have several independent variables?**

4. **What performance measures are most appropriate for evaluating regression models (Simple vs Multiple)?**

5. **How does adding more features (independent variables) affect model complexity and performance?**

6. **What challenges might arise when using multiple features, and how can we address them?**

## Learning Objectives

By the end of Week 9, students will be able to:
- Distinguish between Simple and Multiple Linear Regression
- Build Multiple Linear Regression models with multiple features
- Select appropriate performance measures for regression problems
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like R², RMSE, and MAE
- Interpret model coefficients in the context of multiple predictors
- Understand when to apply different performance measures

---

## Key Concepts

### Multiple Linear Regression
- Equation: y = β₀ + β₁x₁ + β₂x₂ + ... + βₙxₙ + ε
- Multiple independent variables predicting one dependent variable
- Feature relationships and interactions
- Coefficient interpretation with multiple predictors

### Performance Measures for Regression
- R-squared (R²) - Explained variance
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) - Prediction error magnitude
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE) - Average prediction error
- Adjusted R² - Accounting for number of features
