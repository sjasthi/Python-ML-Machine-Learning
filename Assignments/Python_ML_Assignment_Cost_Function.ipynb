        "\n",
        "In machine learning, a **cost function** (also called a loss function) measures how well a model's predictions match the actual values.\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of it like this:\n",
        "- Your model makes predictions\n",
        "- We compare those predictions to the real values\n",
        "- The cost function tells us \"how wrong\" the model is\n",

        "### What is RMSE?\n",
        "\n",
        "**RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)** is one of the most common cost functions for regression problems (predicting continuous values like house prices).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Formula:**\n",
        "\n",
        "RMSE = √(Sum of (Actual - Predicted)² / Number of data points)\n",

        "- Σ = sum of all values\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why Square the Errors?\n",
        "1. Makes all errors positive (avoids negative errors canceling out positive ones)\n",
        "2. Penalizes large errors more heavily\n",
        "3. Common in statistics and optimization\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why Take the Square Root?\n",
        "- Returns the error to the same units as the original data\n",
        "- Makes it easier to interpret (if predicting house prices in thousands, RMSE is also in thousands)\n",
