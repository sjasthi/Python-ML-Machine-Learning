# Assignment: Explore Machine Learning with Teachable Machine

## Overview
**Points:** 25 points  
**Tool:** [Teachable Machine with Google](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/)  
**Due Date:** [Insert Due Date]

In this assignment, you'll become a machine learning engineer! You will train your own AI model using Google's Teachable Machine and see how computers learn from examples.

---

## Learning Objectives
By completing this assignment, you will:
- Experience how machine learning models are trained
- Understand how computers learn from examples (training data)
- See the relationship between features (inputs) and predictions (outputs)
- Learn about overfitting and the importance of good training data

## Assignment Instructions

### Part 1: Create Your ML Model (15 points)

**Step 1: Start an Image Project**
Go to [https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) and click on **"Image Project"** to get started.

**Step 2: Train Your Model**
Create a model with **at least 3 different classes**. Here are some fun ideas:

**Image Project Ideas:**
- Rock, Paper, Scissors detector
- Happy, Sad, Surprised face detector
- Different hand gestures (thumbs up, peace sign, OK sign)
- Objects on your desk (pen, notebook, phone)
- Different colored objects
- Showing/hiding your face
- Different number of fingers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

**Step 3: Collect Training Data**
- For EACH class, collect **at least 30 examples** (more is better!)
- Make your examples diverse (different angles, lighting, backgrounds)
- Click "Train Model" button when you're done collecting examples

**Step 4: Test Your Model**
- Look at the **Preview** section on the right side of the screen
- Show your webcam the different classes you trained
- Watch as the model makes predictions in real-time!
- The bars show how confident the model is about each prediction
- If your model makes mistakes, go back and add more training examples

**Step 4: Export Your Model**
- Once you're happy with your model, click "Export Model"
- Choose "Upload my model" and get the shareable link
- Save this link for your submission

### Part 2: Reflection Questions (10 points)

Answer the following questions in a document (Google Doc, Word, or PDF):

1. **What did you create?** (2 points)
   - Describe your project and the 3+ classes you trained

2. **How accurate is your model?** (2 points)
   - Does it work well? When does it make mistakes?
   - Give specific examples

3. **Training Data Matters** (3 points)
   - How many examples did you collect for each class?
   - Did you try with fewer examples first? What happened?
   - Why is having more examples helpful?

4. **Real-World Connection** (3 points)
   - How does this relate to what we learned about features and predictions?
   - Can you think of a real-world application where this type of ML could be useful?
   - What could go wrong if the training data wasn't good?

---

## What to Submit

Submit the following to [submission platform]:

1. **Your Teachable Machine Link** - The shareable link to your trained model
2. **Screenshots** - Take 2-3 screenshots showing:
   - Your training classes with examples
   - Your model making predictions (testing)
3. **Reflection Document** - Your answers to the Part 2 questions

## Grading Rubric

| Component | Points | Criteria |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| **Model Complexity** | 5 | Created model with 3+ classes, each with 30+ examples |
| **Model Quality** | 5 | Model works reasonably well; evidence of testing and refinement |
| **Export & Link** | 5 | Successfully exported model and provided working shareable link |
| **Reflection Depth** | 8 | Thoughtful, complete answers with specific examples |
| **Connection to Concepts** | 2 | Connected the activity to ML concepts learned in class |
| **Total** | **25** | |

## Tips for Success

âœ“ **More examples = better model!** Try to collect at least 50 examples per class  
âœ“ **Variety matters** - Use different angles, lighting, and backgrounds  
âœ“ **Test as you go** - Keep testing your model and add more examples where it fails  
âœ“ **Have fun!** Be creative with your project ideas  
âœ“ **Ask questions** - If you get stuck, ask your teacher or classmates for help

---

## Bonus Challenge (Optional +3 points)

Create a **second model** that demonstrates overfitting:
- Train a model with only 5 examples per class
- Compare it to your main model with 30+ examples per class
- Explain the difference in performance in your reflection
