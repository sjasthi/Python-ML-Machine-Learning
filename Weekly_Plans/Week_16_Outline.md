## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

✅ Explain what Random Forests are and how they work  
✅ Understand Bootstrap Aggregating (Bagging)  
✅ Compare single Decision Trees vs Random Forests  
✅ Implement Random Forest Classifier and Regressor in Python  
✅ Interpret feature importance from Random Forests  
✅ Evaluate Random Forest models and tune hyperparameters
