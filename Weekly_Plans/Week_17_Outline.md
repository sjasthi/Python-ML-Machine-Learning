# Week 17: Ensemble Methods - Boosting, Stacking, and Voting

**Python for Machine Learning Course**  
**Metro State University | Learn and Help Program**  
**Instructor: Siva**

---

## 📅 Week Overview

This week builds on Week 16's Random Forests lesson by introducing three more powerful ensemble techniques: Boosting, Stacking, and Voting.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, students will be able to:

1. Explain how Boosting differs from Bagging (sequential vs parallel)
2. Describe the two-level architecture of Stacking
3. Compare Hard Voting and Soft Voting
4. Implement ensemble methods using scikit-learn
5. Choose appropriate ensemble methods for different problems

---

## 📚 Key Concepts

- **Boosting**: Sequential learning where each model fixes previous mistakes
- **Stacking**: Two-level learning with base models and a meta-learner
- **Voting**: Democratic combination of model predictions (hard and soft)
- **Model Diversity**: Why different types of models strengthen ensembles

## 🤔 Discussion Questions

1. Why does Boosting train models sequentially instead of in parallel?
2. How does Stacking's meta-model know how to combine base model predictions?
3. When would Soft Voting be better than Hard Voting?
4. Why is model diversity so important in ensemble methods?
