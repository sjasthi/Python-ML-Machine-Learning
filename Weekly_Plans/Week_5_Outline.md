## Topics Covered

### 1. Introduction to Machine Learning
- **What is Machine Learning?**
  - Definition and core principles
  - Learning from data to make predictions
  - Applications in real-world scenarios

### 2. Predictions and Features
- **Predictions (Target Variable)**
  - What we're trying to predict
  - Understanding the output of ML models
  
- **Features (Basis for Predictions)**
  - Input variables used to make predictions
  - Types of features: numerical, categorical, etc.

### 3. Feature Engineering
- **Picking the Best Features**
  - Importance of feature selection
  - Feature relevance and redundancy
  
- **Feature Weights**
  - How features contribute to predictions
  - Understanding feature importance

### 4. Bias vs. Variance Trade-off
- **Bias: The Underfitting Problem**
  - Too simple model
  - High bias = poor performance on training and test data
  - Model fails to capture underlying patterns
  
- **Variance: The Overfitting Problem**
  - Too complex model
  - High variance = excellent training performance, poor test performance
  - Model memorizes training data instead of learning patterns
  
- **The Balanced Model**
  - Goal: **Low bias, low variance**
  - Finding the sweet spot between simplicity and complexity
  - Achieving good generalization

### 5. Cost Function
- **What is a Cost Function?**
  - Measure of model accuracy
  - Quantifies prediction errors
  
- **Selecting the Best Model**
  - Choose model with the best (lowest) cost function value
  - Using cost functions to optimize model parameters

## Assignment Due This Week

### Assignment 3: Exploring Cost Function
- **Due Date:** October 10, 2025 (Thursday)
- **Description:** Hands-on exploration of cost functions in machine learning
- **Assignment Link:** [Python ML Assignment - Cost Function](https://github.com/sjasthi/Python-ML-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Assignments/Python_ML_Assignment_Cost_Function.ipynb)
- **What to Complete:** Work through the Jupyter notebook to understand how cost functions measure model performance

## Key Takeaways
✓ Machine learning uses features to make predictions about target variables  
✓ Feature engineering is crucial for model performance  
✓ Balance between bias (underfitting) and variance (overfitting) is essential  
✓ Cost functions help us evaluate and optimize our models  
✓ The goal is a balanced model with low bias and low variance
